## Welcome to Refreshment Investment repository

This is simple app use to check and save daily investments for refreshments.

### RoomDatabase

# Other
# Samosa 
# Self

### Report

This app has two fragments, MainFragment and ReportFragment
1. MainFragment use to enter investment detail and adding balance (give to office boy for ease so he does not ask daily for money to buy investment) and we can also look in report like how much we invested in month.

2. ReportFragment use to generate report as list of each transaction in cardview in recylerview by start date and end date.
